# Time complexity : O(n).

# Although the time complexity appears to be quadratic due to the while loop nested within the for loop,
#  closer inspection reveals it to be linear. Because the while loop is reached only when currentNum marks the beginning of a sequence 
# (i.e. currentNum-1 is not present in nums), the while loop can only run for nn iterations throughout the entire runtime of the algorithm. 
# This means that despite looking like O(n \cdot n)O(nâ‹…n) complexity, the nested loops actually run in O(n + n) = O(n)O(n+n)=O(n) time.
#  All other computations occur in constant time, so the overall runtime is linear.
